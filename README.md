**INSPIRATION**


"Genetic disorders arise due to mutations in the DNA sequence, which can either be acquired or inherited from one's parents. These genetic mutations can potentially result in serious illnesses such as Alzheimer’s, cancer, and Hemochromatosis. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence-based techniques has shown remarkable success in predicting and diagnosing various diseases. The potential of these methods can be harnessed to early detect genetic disorders using genomic data, enabling timely intervention and treatment. This study addresses the multi-label multi-class challenge in genetic disorder prediction by making two significant contributions. First, it introduces a novel approach to feature engineering, combining class probabilities from both Extra Trees (ET) and Random Forest (RF) to create a feature set for model training. Second, it employs the classifier chain method, where multiple classifiers are linked together in a chain, with each classifier using predictions from the previous ones to make the final diagnosis. Given the complexity of multi-label multi-class data, the study evaluates performance using macro accuracy, Hamming loss, and α-evaluation score. The results indicate that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms other methods, achieving an impressive α-evaluation score of 92% and a macro accuracy score of 84%. XGB's performance surpasses that of state-of-the-art approaches, excelling in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency."
